Denmark, 1450. city of Elsinore. A 19 years old girl looks at herself in the mirror in the morning. This is you. Ofelia. Your mother died a long time ago. Ever since you can remember your family has been just your father, Polonio, and your
brother, Laertes, both of which you have a good relationship with. You are part of the Denmark nobility, and right now you’re in love with the prince Hamlet. It is your hope he feels the same for you. You sometimes feel sad, but surely that
feeling will go away if you ignore it. You try to make sure no one notices. You don’t know this yet, but your destiny has already been writen. It’s a story filled with tragedy and desperation. Will you be able to find a way to escape this
destiny and save yourself? Will you be able to save them all? The fight against destiny starts. They’re right. You have no certainty that Hamlet wants to marry you, and with the actual situation it’s not a good idea to keep that hope alive.
You promise your dad not to get close to Hamlet again. They’re wrong! In your heart, you still keep the hope of marrying Hamlet, he’s the love of your life, no matter what others say. You tell this to your father. He insists it’s a bad idea
to continue having hope for Hamlet, but accepts that you can make your own decisions. For several days nothing of importance happens, the most entertaining thing that happens is the rumor of a ghost in the castle of Elsinore. Hamlet has
kept writting you letters, as usual, but you remember your brother and father’s words, and decide to ignore the mail. You have kept exchanging letters with Hamlet, as usual, but you can’t help but to notice each letter he sends keeps
becoming shorter and shorter. One day, while you read a novel inside your room, the window opens suddenly. The person finishes climbing the window. It’s Hamlet. “We can arrange an encounter between you and hamlet, make it look accidental.
Meanwhile, I will hide to judge his reaction. That way I would be sure it’s what I’m thinking it is. “It’s a good plan.” “It’s a terrible plan” “Well, I don’t need to see you again,” he says, “In truth, I think I loved you once, but not
anymore.” “It’s true what everyone says! You’ve completely lost your mind! “How can you say something like that?! If I should be in a convent, that only means you should be in a mental asylum! Nutjob!” Some days after there’s an
announcement for a theater play at the palace, organized by Hamlet. Will you assist? Don’t go to the play. The palace’s theater has been prepared for the play. It seems it will be presented by a very famous acting trope. When you get to the
teather, there are two free seats. You could sit beside Hamlet, or you could take a seat beside king Claudius. Sit beside Hamlet. Sit beside the king. You don’t really feel like going to the play. Lately you haven’t been feeling like doing
anything. You decide not to attend the play. You’re simply not interested. Instead, you stay home and sleep all way. The play tells the story of a king murdered by his own brother, in an attempt to take over the crown. The actors are good
and the story is interesting, You take advantage of one of the intermissions to tell Hamlet you liked the story. “It’s based on real facts,” says Hamlet. “Really?” you ask. “Of course, you know something like this really happened because in
fictional stories the wife is loyal to the husband, and even waits for him when it’s believed he’s dead, or sacrifices herself in some way. In the real world they all are treacherous bitches that backstab their husbands and sons on the
first chance they have. Or, if they aren’t married yet, then they convince men they’re in love and then stop sending letters for no reason.” “Ah, but of course, that’s more common with beautiful women. The ugly ones are so desperate that
they sit beside whoever they’re interested in all the time, like brainles cows, even when it’s clear that their beloved doesn’t return their affections. They’re able even to sit beside him in the theater and praise the script they wrote,
even when it’s clear they’re too illiterate to understand a single scene shown in the play.” You won’t stand this man saying such things. You slap Hamlet, and, before he can do something about it, leave your seat and leave the theater.
There’s still a little less than an hour for the play to end. Should you do something in the meantime? Look for something to do in the meantime. Go home “They’re really annoying, women. But you have to accept they have their uses here and
there. Especially the whores that have more experience than virgins.” “What are you doing after the play, Ophelia? Won’t you come with me to some empty room later?” Ignore him Slap him The play barely gets to the fourth act when king
Claudio stands up and orders for it to stop, saying that, apparently, he didn’t like the play at all. In this sudden way, the play gets to its end. Your father said that today he would stay until night at the palace. You could stay and do
something else while you want, so you can go home together, or you could go home by yourself. Follow Claudius Go home Stay here It’s Hamlet’s fault Alongside the news of your father’s death, you also hear that Hamlet is traveling abroad
this very same afternoon. What other motive could he have to run away so suddenly? That scoundrel is no longer the man you used the know, he is no longer the friend for whom you fell in love. he followed the same path as his uncle and
turned into a murderer. First he breaks your heart, now he dares to murder your family. It’s unforgivable. You stayed home while your father was murdered. You could have been by his side, and decided against it. It’s your fault, it’s all
your fault, if you hadn’t left him alone this wouldn’t have happened. [[End1]] It's the king's fault. Why else would he refuse to conduct an investigation? And apparently it was also the king who found the body. It's too suspicious. You
have no doubt, King Claudius murdered his brother, and now your father as well. Did your father suspect his crime? Or was he a pawn that he had to eliminate for the benefit of another plan? Whatever it is.... There's no way you can forgive
something like that. You decide to write a letter to Laertes telling him what happened. Although your brother is still in France, he has always been good at giving advice. You hope that his next letter will help you decide what to do.
Should you tell your father too? That's a good idea. No->Diversion2 You decide it's best to keep the secret. One week later You can't take this any longer and you just run out of there. 4.045 / 5.000 Weeks go by, and you can't get this
unhappy feeling out of your heart. Everything you see reminds you of your father and how you could have saved him if only you had been there. The food tastes like nothing, the songs of the birds no longer bring you any joy. You spend your
days singing vulgar songs and wandering around like someone who has lost her soul. People say you lost your mind, maybe you did. You stop in front of a river, and look at the flowers that bloom on the shore. “Well, I'm afraid I won't be
able to help you with that,” he tells you, “Hamlet is the kind of person who doesn't talk much about his feelings. Even I don't know for sure what he thinks about others. You show up at the port with the excuse of wanting to say goodbye. No
one finds this strange, since the deterioration of your relationship with Hamlet is not public knowledge. When you appear before him, Hamlet does not look you in the eye. That's all you need to know for sure that your hunch is correct. You
finally find your father near the royal chambers. You are about to call out to him, when you see him open a hidden door in the wall and disappear into a secret room. Follow It's best not to get involved A few days later you visit the palace
and, as planned, go to one of the less frequented gardens in the southern area, where Horacio | your father assured you that Hamlet can be found. Horacio wishes you good luck, and tells you that he will be waiting in a nearby corridor. Your
father tells you that he will be hiding behind one of the doors that lead to the garden, listening to the conversation. You thank him, and go inside. Hamlet is in front of one of the rose bushes. It may be your impression, but it seems to
you that he was talking to himself when you entered. “Good morning, Hamlet.” Hamlet stands in front of the window and simply looks at you without saying anything nor approaching. Say nothing Approach You wait for Hamlet to say something,
but he just stands there quietly. After you watch him for a while he just nods and leaves through the window. Hamlet still doesn't say anything. When you approach him, he just looks away. His eyes look like those of someone who has been
crying. "Are you okay?" "Have you gone crazy?!" You spend the rest of the day looking out the window, wondering what happened. You could almost believe that your encounter with Hamlet was just a dream, but you know it was real. "And what do
you care? You've been ignoring me anyway." Hamlet replies, suddenly looking angry. Before you can say anything else, Hamlet turns around and leaves through the same window he used to come in. You didn't expect that ignoring his letters
would hurt him, but now... Hamlet shrugs, still unable to meet your eyes. After a moment he just nods, turns around and leaves through the same window he used to come in. What is Hamlet thinking?! He can't go into your room just like that!
He almost gave you a heart attack. Hamlet looks away, "I wanted to see you," “You've been ignoring me.” | "Is that so bad?"] "You're crazy, get the hell out of here." "...Okay." Several days go by and you're still not sure what to think
about Hamlet's visit. You've also started hearing rumors about how the prince seems to have lost his mind, acting strangely and constantly talking to himself. It's worrying. Maybe you should tell someone about his visit? Tell your father
Tell your brother Tell Horacio Keep It Secret You decide to tell your father about Hamlet's visit. Polonius listens carefully to what you have to say, and once your story is over he declares: "I see, now I understand the source of Hamlet's
madness." "What is it??" Your father seems surprised at your refusal. "Are you sure? I really thought it was a good idea.” "...Alright." "I said no." Sounds good. You've always had trouble reading people, so your father's help could be
valuable here. "Okay, let's do that." you tell him, and the two of you immediately start planning how to arrange the meeting with Hamlet. A few days later.. You feel that having written to your brother is enough. You decide there is no need
to tell anyone else about it. One week late The next day the news arrives that your father has died. Murdered. His body was discovered under one of the palace stairs. The murderer has not been identified, and King Claudius refuses to start
an investigation. It's Hamlet's fault [It's Claudio's fault It's your fault ^These are your stats^ You are currently quite in love with Hamlet, although not enough to do anything for him, and you are not particularly unhappy at the moment.
Your feelings will change according to your decisions. Surely many interesting things will happen depending on how you feel. Your brother has spent the last few years studying in France. With the death of the previous king, Hamlet's father,
Laertes had to return to attend the coronation of the new king, King Claudius. Now that some time has passed since then, your brother asked King Claudius for permission to return to France to continue his education. You and your father
decided to accompany him to the port to say goodbye. It will be a while before you see him again. This makes you feel... Sad Happy The truth is you don't want him to go. Exchanging letters is not the same as having your family together at
home. You will feel lonely without your brother around. Since you don't want to make him feel bad before he leaves, you don't tell anyone this. Your brother wanted to go back to France almost as soon as he got back. He hasn't stopped
talking about all the friends he misses and the things he's learned abroad, and he's been quite cheerful ever since he was given permission to leave Denmark. You're going to miss him, but overall you're happy for him. Anyway, you can always
write letters to each other. Before leaving, your brother warns you to stay away from Hamlet. He doesn't believe that Hamlet truly loves you, and with the previous king's death he fears the problems that may arise if you continue to get
involved with him, especially now that Laertes won't be here to protect you. "Honestly, your brother is right," your father tells you, "You would do well to stay away from Hamlet." They... They're right They're wrong But what… You don't
waste time, and you push out whoever is trying to get into your room. Oh my God, it's Hamlet Someone is trying to get in through the window!! Push him Wait to see who it is You just made Hamlet, Prince of Denmark fall 3 stories. Hamlet
is... He's dead, oh my God, he's dead, you killed him, oh God "...I'm sure he's fine." Oh my God, oh my God, Ophelia, you killed the Prince of Denmark and the protagonist, oh my God you've ruined the story and killed Hamlet and it's only
Act 2. What do we do?! Confess your crime Hide the corpse A few minutes pass and Hamlet stands up, holding his head and looking dazed. He looks up and makes a rude gesture before leaving. Somehow, you feel like your respect for him has
diminished a bit... You confess your crime to the local authorities. Even if it was an accident, and regardless of whether he was the one who tried to enter through the window, causing the death of a prince is a serious crime. Your father
pleads for you in front of King Claudius, and your brother returns from abroad to be present at the trial. After days of deliberation, there is finally a verdict. As punishment for your part in Hamlet's death, you are sentenced to exile
from Denmark. It is early in the morning and both your father and the servants are still sleeping. You run down the stairs as fast as you can without making a sound. Outside, there is no one around to see what happened… You may still be
able to escape the consequences of Hamlet's death. No one can know what happened, you have to hide the body! Where will you hide it? People will start waking up soon and there is no time to go very far carrying Hamlet's body. For now, you
could try dragging it to the wine cellar below your house, then burying it in the woods when night falls. The cellar is rarely used, but there's always a chance your father or a servant will find it before you can get rid of it. On the
other hand, you could leave it in the neighboring garden. The family of that house expressed opposition to the coronation of King Claudius, if they find Prince Hamlet's body in his property they may be blamed. What will you do? In the wine
cellar In the neighbor's garden King Claudius is benevolent, and he allows you to join your brother on his journey abroad. He is also allowed to continue exchanging letters with your family and friends in Denmark. You still do not fully
understand how you reached this ending, and you feel that there are still several issues that you do not know about. Every time you think of Hamlet, your chest feels tight and your heart fills with sadness. But life goes on. On the ship on
the way to France, you look towards the horizon, and you wonder what the future holds… //''Ending #8: Far from home the future is uncertain''// A narrow corridor leads you to a small room lit by a single candle. Three walls of the room are
made of stone, while the fourth appears to be some kind of thin tapestry hung as a curtain. It is at this moment that your father finally realizes that you followed him. "Ophelia?" he whispers, a scolding on the tip of his tongue, "But what
are you doing here?" “I…” You don't have time to reply, when you hear voices from the other side of the tapestry. It's hard to keep your composure after what's happened, but you can't go hysterical if you want to be allowed back into the
palace. No one thinks of checking your dress for hidden daggers. King Claudius had a really strange reaction to the play. Driven by your curiosity, you decide to follow him after he leaves the theater. You follow him to a small chapel in a
little-used wing of the castle, within which he kneels and begins to pray. You drag the body to the neighbor's property. The main gate is open, as usual. You leave Hamlet's body under a bush near the entrance. It should be hidden enough for
several hours to pass before they find it. “Hey! Who's there?!" One of the neighbor's servants noticed you entered the property. Quick, you have to run! Run Right Run Left While touring the palace, you come across Horace, sitting in one of
the outside balconies. Leave him alone Approach Unable to support your weight, your legs buckle and you fall to the ground. Your father is at your side, trying to stop the flow of blood, but it is too much. You’re cold. When you raise your
eyes, Hamlet’s hace has an expression or pure horror. Everything becomes dark… //''Ending #4: What happens to nosy people''// It is unforgivable. IT IS UNFORGIVABLE You pick up Hamlet's sword, which fell to the ground during the commotion.
The blade is still stained with your father's blood. Without thinking twice you drive it through Hamlet's chest. Hamlet shakes his head, "You know what I mean." You take a step in his direction, but Hamlet steps back. "Why do you avoid me?"
you say, “Why do you keep pushing me away? Do you really want me to hate you?" Hamlet looks away. He says, “Why are you still nice to me? I don't understand." “I heard your uncle's confession.” "Because you are a valuable person for me" You
do not know what to do. Your whole body shakes and you can't stop crying. How could this happen? No, it has to be a nightmare! You have not yet finished processing what happened, when you feel a pain in your chest. When you look down, there
is a red stain expanding on your dress, and a sharp blade protruding from the center. When you look up, the queen is holding the handle of the sword. “Stop insisting on doing everything on your own,” you tell him. “Look, I already know the
secret even if you don't want me to, so you can only kill me or let me help. Hmm, what do you say? What's it gonna be?" Hamlet laughs. It is a wet laugh and full of unshed tears. He puts his head on your shoulder, and starts crying. Perhaps
if you had confessed earlier you would have had more luck convincing the authorities that it was an accident, but after trying to hide the body there is enough evidence to condemn you to the gallows. Standing on the execution platform, you
look up at the sky and wonder how this could have happened. //''Ending #9: Eventually it all comes out''// A part of you feels that it can't possibly have been that easy to evade the consequences. At first you spend every second of the day
convinced that your guilt will eventually be discovered, but it's as if no one has any interest in further investigating the prince's murder. It's almost as if the people in the palace are relieved at his tragic death. Eventually you
realize you've gotten away with it, and as long as you keep your mouth shut, no one is going to blame you for what happened. Every time you think of Hamlet, your chest feels tight and your heart fills with sadness, but it's not like
confessing will bring him back to life. In the end, what is one more secret in the court of Denmark? //''Ending #10: One More Secret''// Horace is Hamlet's best friend. Maybe he'll know something about it. You manage to find Horacio a few
days later, reading a book in the library. "Hello Horacio, do you have a moment?" you tell him, and he sets the book aside. You tell Horacio what happened with Hamlet's visit, and ask him what you should do about it. He is silently in
thought for a while, until he finally answers. "What do you want to know, really?" "Something's wrong with him. I'm worried about him. "I want to know what he thinks of me." "I wouldn't know what to tell you, but maybe you should ask him
directly." You've thought about it, but since that strange encounter you haven't seen him again, and you don't know where to find him. You tell Horacio this, and he seems to think about it for a while, “I guess I could help you arrange a
meeting with him,” he tells you, “Visit the palace in a few days, I'll make sure he's where you can find him. Maybe you can reason with him.” A few days later… You're not paying attention to where you're going while running and you end up
bumping into Horacio. “Ophelia? What happened? You're crying:" You tell Horace what Hamlet told you. Hearing your account of what happened, a complicated expression appears on his face, and after a moment he grabs your wrist and drags you
back into the garden. From your hiding place, you watch as Hamlet raises his sword 3 times, each time stopping before lunging at the King. His hands are shaking, his face is pale. The only reason Claudius is unaware of his presence is
because of his own crying, which prevents him from hearing Hamlet's heavy breathing. Eventually Hamlet takes a deep breath, turns around, and heads out the back door of the chapel. As he's closing the door behind him, you could swear his
gaze rests on you for just a second, his eyes widening and his posture stiffening for a moment, but it's dark and he's across the room, so it could be your imagination What should you do now? What you just heard is a huge secret! You have 2
ideas. You could go home and think about what to do next, or you could find your father and tell him about the scene you witnessed right now. Find your father Go Home "Yes, I know that my crime is nauseating." Whispers the king, "It is the
crime of the fratricidal Cain, cursed of the earth. I want to pray and I cannot, for my remorse holds me back. If this hand of mine were blackened with the dark blood of my brother, would there be enough rain in the sky to make it white as
snow? Thus, you hear King Claudius confess to the murder of his brother. At the same time, you see how Hamlet approaches him from behind, sword in hand. Stay hidden "Stop!" There is no point in staying hidden. You lift the tapestry and
enter the room. "Hamlet, it's me, Ophelia!" Seeing who it is, Hamlet immediately lowers his sword. The queen takes advantage of the distraction to escape from the room. Hamlet hesitates for a moment whether to follow her or not, but finally
decides to stay. "Ophelia... What are you doing here?" "Eavesdropping, obviously." //''Ending #7: At least someone tried to protect you''// More servants come to see what all the commotion is about. You could try to scale the property's
fence to escape, or you could hide under the stairs at the side of the house and wait until the path is clear before exiting through the front door. Scale the fence Hide under the stairs You have to hide for several hours before you can
escape, but in the end, nobody finds you, and eventually you find the opportunity to escape from the property. When you return home you find your father, who has been looking for you all day. You apologize for worrying him, and make up an
excuse to answer where you've been. Eventually, the corpse is discovered. The investigation that follows lasts only a few days and is not very rigorous, it is as if they wanted to end the matter as soon as possible. They don't even question
you or your family despite living close to where the body was found. Soon, King Claudo finds the neighbor guilty, and sentences him to the gallows. You decide not to attend the execution, and you pray for the soul of the accused man as well
as your own. You take Hamlet to the cellar and hide him behind some wine barrels. When night falls you will take him to the forest to bury him. Around noon you hear a scream coming from the cellar. One of your servants discovered the body.
The investigation that proceeds lasts several days, and when they interrogate you about it, you cannot help but confess everything. The path you take ends up being a dead end. The servant discovers you and brings you before his master. The
neighbors call the police to report your trespassing on the property, and soon the body is discovered. The investigation that follows is short, everyone knows that you are guilty, and when they question you about it, you cannot help but to
confess to everything. You try to scale the fence, but it's harder than you thought it would be. You are about to reach the top when your hand slips. You fall to the ground and twist your ankle. Your cry of pain attracts the servants you
wanted to evade. The neighbors call the police to report your trespassing on the property, and soon the body is discovered. The investigation that follows is short, everyone knows that you are guilty, and when they question you about it,
you cannot help but to confess to everything. Hamlet is quiet for a while, and eventually, instead of answering, he just nods and leaves. “It was good to see you,” he says as he leaves through the same window he entered. You let out a sigh.
Well, his father died recently, it's okay if he acts a little weird, right? “Okay,” you tell him. "I have missed you too." Hamlet smiles and nods. You smile too. "...But you should go anyway," you tell him. "I'm sorry," Hamlet turns and
leaves through the same window he entered. You don't like the idea of ​​being spied on while you meet Hamlet, and you don't like the idea of ​​arranging false accidental encounters with him. If Hamlet really is in love with you, you want
him to come over and confess when he's ready, rather than start making weird plans about it. Your father is not happy with your decision, but he does not press you further. The play tells the story of a king who is killed by his brother to
take the crown. The actors are good and the story is interesting, but it's hard for you to concentrate on the play because King Claudius seems to get more and more nervous as it progresses, wiping sweat from his forehead and wringing his
hands. It is uncomfortable. "Hamlet has gone mad out of love for you!" "...Ok" "I didn't expect it, but perhaps his affection for you is genuine." Your father continues monologuing without paying attention to you. He sometimes stops
listening when others talk to him, when he's excited. "Sneaking into a lady's room is something you only do when you're in love, I very well know that's how it was when I started dating your mother." "Do you really believe that?" Your
father emphatically nods, "This is a great opportunity. If it really is the case, you might have a chance to become the queen of Denmark in the future!" More than becoming queen, you would be happy just by having Hamlet feel the same way
about you as you do about him... Although being queen is a nice bonus. “We cannot act carelessly. It's important to know if Hamlet has really been acting strange because he's in love," he says, "I have an idea." “What idea?” When you
finally tire of running, you hide in one of the palace's antechambers. Eventually your dad finds you and hugs you. "I'm sorry, it was my fault for telling you to meet him this way." You do not know what to say. You came with the hope that
Hamlet would love you too, not that your feelings would be insulted like this. You feel your eyes moisten. "If I should enter a monastery then you should go to an insane asylum" Run Hamlet nods, but other than that he doesn't greet you
back. "You haven't written to me since the last time I saw you." "How have you been?" "And what does that matter to you?" '"Of course I care. I'm worried about you."' "Everyone's been talking about how you've been acting weird." "You women
are all the same, given the chance you wouldn't hesitate to kill your own husbands or children. You dare to ignore me first, and now you ask me why I got tired of you.” “Now that I think about it, maybe I never loved you. You would do well
to become a nun in a monastery and stay away from the rot of the court." "Although, you're so hideous that I doubt anyone else would so much as consider marrying you." “I don't believe you at all. All the nobles of Denmark are the same,
they are only interested in their own interests and how they can take advantage of others.” “Of course what matters to you is what people say about me. Are you worried about how being with me will affect your reputation? Did someone tell
you to say that? Why are you really here? For a moment, Hamlet seems surprised by your answer. As the surprise wears off, his face turns red with anger, and he opens his mouth to hurl more insults at you. Insult him too Run The conversation
soon turns into nothing more than an exchange of insults. "Crazy!" "Self serving!" "Fool!" "Bitch!" "Bastard! "Slut!" “But what are they doing?!” Horatio, attracted by the noise of the fight, steps into the garden and gives you and Hamlet a
disapproving look. “Aren't they supposed to be close? What are you doing fighting like this? “He started it…” "Sorry..." Hamlet watches you and Horace for a moment before looking away. "...I am sorry." He mutters, before turning and leaving
the garden. Eventually you get tired of this and just run off, your eyes full of tears and your face red with anger. And to think that at some point you felt love for someone like that! Not anymore, you had enough. Fuck Hamlet! He can die
for all you care. Seriously, what's wrong with him?! How could he say all that?! You never thought Hamlet was that kind of person... You don't know what to think. “‘He started it’ What are you, 5 years old?!” "And you!" Horacio turns to
Hamlet, | “Hamlet," Horacio calls out to him as soon as he enters the garden, "I know you are carrying several sorrows, but think about what you are doing and the collateral you are causing! The result of your actions may not be what you
are looking for." Seeing this, Horacio sighs. "Please don't take his words too seriously," he tells you, "You know he hasn't been the same ever since his father..." '“...Okay, I forgive him.” “You say that but…”' It is true that many things
have happened lately. You're not happy about it, but for now you suppose you'll forgive him. For now. As if you could just forget everything he said to you… Absolutely not. There isn't much else to do here, so you decide to go home on your
own. There isn't much to entertain you with in the palace. Usually when you visit you spend your time chatting with Hamlet, but it is clear that this will no longer be possible. In the end you decide to take a carriage home, and then spend
the rest of the day reading books and sleeping. The next day... You wander around the palace for a few hours, visit the gardens and so on. The truth is that there is not much to do. You don't know many people in the palace and you don't
know where everything is. Usually when you visit it's to hang out with Hamlet. When both of you were younger you used to play hide and seek in the gardens or steal sweets from the kitchen together…. But things change over time. Eventually
you decide that enough time must have passed for your father to have finished his work and decide to look for him. Find your father Horacio greets you with a smile and invites you to sit with him. You ask him about the book he's reading,
and the two of you talk about books for a while. Eventually Horacio asks why you aren't at the theater watching the play. “I just didn't like the story.” Tell him what happened to Hamlet Hamlet goes on saying vile things for a while, almost
as if he meant to annoy you on purpose, but you resolve to just ignore him and concentrate on the play. Even if Claudius has just confessed to such a terrible murder, you don't want to see Hamlet murder his own uncle. "Do not do it!" you
exclaim, coming out of hiding. Your cry alerts the king to Hamlet's presence. Claudius lunges at him and manages to snatch the sword from his hand. You decide what to do later. At the moment the most important thing is to get out of the
palace. You take a carriage home and spend the whole night thinking about what to do. You wait for your father to come back to tell him what happened, but… The next day… The king lunges at Hamlet, but Hamlet evades the blow. Seeing that you
are closer to the door, Claudius decides to attack you. You can already feel the edge of the sword on your skin, when at the last moment Hamlet pushes you aside and takes the hit instead. He seems to be busy reading a book and you don't
want to disturb him. It's not like you're close with Horace anyway, and you still feel awkward after what happened the other time with Hamlet. Something in his look makes you think that Horacio knows you're lying, but he doesn't say
anything about it and you continue talking about books. Eventually it starts to get late and you say goodbye. Maybe your father is already free to go home. "I suppose it would be unfair of me to ask you to forgive him a second time.|"Even
though I am his friend, even I cannot deny that Hamlet has indeed treated you horribly. If you feel like you don't want Hamlet back in your life, I couldn't blame you for it," he tells you. "However, please believe me when I tell you that I
know you are still important to him, even if he has decided to act like the opposite." "The truth is that Hamlet is so lost in his own sorrows that not even my words could reach him now..." "Maybe I can help in some way?" "You should quit.
Hamlet really went crazy." Horacio seems surprised by your answer. “With everything that's happened, I could never ask such a thing of you,” he replies, “... But, if you really want to support him, I'll help you however I can too. Maybe
between the two of us we can stop that stubborn Hamlet from doing something stupid." Things have been complicated lately, but maybe they can still be fixed. You stay chatting with Horacio a while longer, until the sky begins to turn red.
Surely the play has already finished. You could find your father and see if he's ready to go home… Or maybe it would be a good idea to find Hamlet and try talking to him one more time. Find Hamlet Find your father “I guess that's how most
people would see it. But I can't abandon a friend no matter what." Horacio obviously doesn't want to continue the conversation after that. He doesn't tell you this, but you feel that you are no longer welcome in his presence. You decide to
say goodbye and spend some more time wandering around the palace. It's more nostalgic than it should be. When you were both younger, you and Hamlet used to play hide-and-seek in the gardens or steal sweets from the kitchen. He always knew
how to make you laugh, and he never made fun of you when something as small as a novel or a poem made you cry... But things change over time. Eventually you decide that enough time must have passed for your father to have finished his work
and decide to look for him. After searching for a while, you think you see Hamlet making his way to one of the less busy wings of the palace. You try to follow him, but soon you lose sight of him. Eventually, you hear sounds coming from a
small room used as a private chapel, and when you peek inside you see King Claudius on his knees, praying alone. "Did you enjoy the play? ...Or, perhaps playing the death of a king was too close to reality, with what has been happening in
Elsinore lately?" It is the voice of Hamlet. "Don't you think you've grieved long enough over your father's death? It's time to move on." the voice of the queen answers. The conversation soon turns into an argument and then a fight, both
Hamlet and the queen raising their voices to the point of screaming. It is only thanks to King Claudius's confession that you manage to understand the meaning of their words. Hamlet is accusing his mother of plotting to murder his father...
And based on what you've heard, you're inclined to believe that the queen really was involved. | Although there's clearly a hidden meaning behind the fight, no matter how hard you try you can't fully understand why they're arguing in the
first place, except that it has something to do with the death of Hamlet's father. You and your father move closer to the tapestry to listen better. Stand to the right of the tapestry Stand to the left of the tapestry Suddenly the
discussion stops. "Who dares to spy on us?" you hear Hamlet say, followed by the footsteps of someone approaching the tapestry. Stay Hidden No No No No "Father?! Father! Dad!" No matter how much you scream and cry, the dead don't come back
to life. Nobody moves to help you, not even Hamlet, who has just stabbed Polonius and does nothing about it, he only looks at you in horror. It is clear that he did not expect you to be the one on the other side of the tapestry. How could
this happen? It's unforgivable Seeing the scene, the queen runs away. She will no doubt bring the guards, no doubt you will be executed right here and now for this. Somehow you don’t care much about it. //''Ending #5: It's unforgivable''//
Your body falls next to your father's, and before you close your eyes, you can see your own surprise reflected on Hamlet's face. Behind him, the queen is raising her sword once more. You try to open her mouth to warn her, but all that comes
out is a mouthful of blood. Everything becomes dark. //''Ending #6: No Witnesses''// Soon the news of your death arrive, a witness says that you fell into the river and simply sank. Nobody is sure if it was a suicide or an accident, the
only thing that everyone can say with certainty is that it is a tragedy. //''Ending #1: What is already written cannot be changed ''// Your plan is not complicated or especially difficult. As soon as the king approaches to express his
condolences, a blow to the neck is all it takes. //''Ending #3: Revenge is best served simple. ''// No one thought to check your dress in case there was a hidden dagger. One hit is all it takes, and you feel no remorse. //''Ending #2:
Broken hearts are dangerous''// Hamlet sighs, his shoulders drop, his posture relaxes, but he doesn't seem calm, rather he looks defeated. “...I know, I saw you standing on the door. But that should be even more of a reason to stay away
from me." “Hamlet...” You take another step forward, and another, and another. This time Hamlet does not evade you. You put your arms around his shoulders, and you feel his body begin to tremble. “Sorry, I just…” he murmurs. "You're a
fucking idiot." “Okay, I forgive you.” “You too…” he sighs, “You're important to me too, Ophelia. But that's why you shouldn't love me." "What do you mean?" “Don't pretend you don't know,” Hamlet sighs, “I saw you at the chapel door. You
heard it all, didn't you?" “Hamlet...” With the queen and king suspecting that Hamlet is plotting revenge for his father, it is not safe for him to stay in Denmark. After sharing the secret with your father, he agrees with you that it is
not safe for you either, especially after the queen saw you eavesdropping on her conversation with Hamlet. In the end you convince Hamlet to go to France together, where they can meet with Laertes and plan your next move. Hamlet still plans
to assassinate King Claudius. "It's unforgivable," he says when he talks about his father's death. There is simply no convincing him otherwise. You're, personally, not so sure about his decision, but at the end of the day you're already
involved. You hope that, with you by his side, you can at least prevent the story from ending as a tragedy. //''True ending: The journey continues''// Please look forward to playing //Ophelia's Redemption: Act 2//, coming October 2023
